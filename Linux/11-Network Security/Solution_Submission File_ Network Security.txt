## Unit 11 Submission File: Network Security Homework 


### Part 1: Review Questions 


#### Security Control Types


The concept of defense in depth can be broken down into three different security control types. Identify the security control type of each set  of defense tactics.


1. Walls, bollards, fences, guard dogs, cameras, and lighting are what type of security control?


    Answer: Physical security


2. Security awareness programs, BYOD policies, and ethical hiring practices are what type of security control?


    Answer: Management/Admin Security


3. Encryption, biometric fingerprint readers, firewalls, endpoint security, and intrusion detection systems are what type of security control?


    Answer: Operational security


#### Intrusion Detection and Attack indicators


1. What's the difference between an IDS and an IPS?


    Answer: IDS are passive and alert potential attacks. They do not respond to attacks, 
they log and document.


IPS can do everything an IDS can but can also take action on attacks. IPS can react to packets by blocking malicious traffic, preventing it from being delivered to a host on the network.


2. What's the difference between an Indicator of Attack and an Indicator of Compromise?


   Answer: IOA indicates attacks happening in real time. Focuses on intent and end goal of attacker regardless of the exploitation used.


IOC indicates previous malicious activity. Exposes vulnerabilities used in an attack, helping defense in the future.






#### The Cyber Kill Chain


Name each of the seven stages for the Cyber Kill chain and provide a brief example of each.


1. Stage 1: Reconnaissance: harvesting email addresses, conference information, etc.


2. Stage 2: Weaponization: Coupling exploit with backdoor into deliverable payload


3. Stage 3: Delivery: delivering weaponized bundle to victim.


4. Stage 4: Exploitation: exploiting vulnerability to execute code on the victim's system.


5. Stage 5: Installation: installing the malware on the target.


6. Stage 6: Command and control (C2): command channel for remote manipulation of victims.


7. Stage 7: Actions on Objectives: accomplish original goals.




#### Snort Rule Analysis


Use the Snort rule to answer the following questions:


Snort Rule #1


```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 5800:5820 (msg:"ET SCAN Potential VNC Scan 5800-5820"; flags:S,12; threshold: type both, track by_src, count 5, seconds 60; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/2002910; classtype:attempted-recon; sid:2002910; rev:5; metadata:created_at 2010_07_30, updated_at 2010_07_30;)
```


1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.


   Answer: Any inbound TCP traffic from ports 5800 - 5820 on the external network.


2. What stage of the Cyber Kill Chain does this alert violate?


   Answer: Reconnaissance


3. What kind of attack is indicated?


   Answer: VNC scan


Snort Rule #2


```bash
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS -> $HOME_NET any (msg:"ET POLICY PE EXE or DLL Windows file download HTTP"; flow:established,to_client; flowbits:isnotset,ET.http.binary; flowbits:isnotset,ET.INFO.WindowsUpdate; file_data; content:"MZ"; within:2; byte_jump:4,58,relative,little; content:"PE|00 00|"; distance:-64; within:4; flowbits:set,ET.http.binary; metadata: former_category POLICY; reference:url,doc.emergingthreats.net/bin/view/Main/2018959; classtype:policy-violation; sid:2018959; rev:4; metadata:created_at 2014_08_19, updated_at 2017_02_01;)
```


1. Break down the Sort Rule header and explain what is happening.


   Answer: Remote host via http ports tried to deliver an exe file to any port of the local machine.


2. What layer of the Defense in Depth model does this alert violate?


   Answer: Delivery


3. What kind of attack is indicated?


   Answer: Cross site scripting


Snort Rule #3


- Your turn! Write a Snort rule that alerts when traffic is detected inbound on port 4444 to the local network on any port. Be sure to include the `msg` in the Rule Option.


    Answer: alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET 4444 (msg: “”ET Possible Trojan or CrackDown”)


### Part 2: "Drop Zone" Lab


#### Log into the Azure `firewalld` machine


Log in using the following credentials:


- Username: `sysadmin`
- Password: `cybersecurity`


#### Uninstall `ufw`


Before getting started, you should verify that you do not have any instances of `ufw` running. This will avoid conflicts with your `firewalld` service. This also ensures that `firewalld` will be your default firewall.


- Run the command that removes any running instance of `ufw`.


    ```bash
    $ sudo apt remove ufw
    ```


#### Enable and start `firewalld`


By default, these service should be running. If not, then run the following commands:


- Run the commands that enable and start `firewalld` upon boots and reboots.


    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl enable firewalld.service
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/firewalld start
    ```


  Note: This will ensure that `firewalld` remains active after each reboot.


#### Confirm that the service is running.


- Run the command that checks whether or not the `firewalld` service is up and running.


    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl status firewalld.service
    ```




#### List all firewall rules currently configured.


Next, lists all currently configured firewall rules. This will give you a good idea of what's currently configured and save you time in the long run by not doing double work.


- Run the command that lists all currently configured firewall rules:


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –list-all
    ```


- Take note of what Zones and settings are configured. You many need to remove unneeded services and settings.


#### List all supported service types that can be enabled.


- Run the command that lists all currently supported services to see if the service you need is available


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –get-services
    ```


- We can see that the `Home` and `Drop` Zones are created by default.




#### Zone Views


- Run the command that lists all currently configured zones.


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –list-all-zones
    ```


- We can see that the `Public` and `Drop` Zones are created by default. Therefore, we will need to create Zones for `Web`, `Sales`, and `Mail`.


#### Create Zones for `Web`, `Sales` and `Mail`.


- Run the commands that creates Web, Sales and Mail zones.


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –new-zone-web
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –new-zone-sales
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –new-zone-mail
    ```


#### Set the zones to their designated interfaces:


- Run the commands that sets your `eth` interfaces to your zones.


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –change-interface=eth0
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=web –change-interface=eth1
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=sales –change-interface=eth2
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=mail –change-interface=eth3
    ```


#### Add services to the active zones:


- Run the commands that add services to the **public** zone, the **web** zone, the **sales** zone, and the **mail** zone.


- Public:


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=public –add-service=http
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=public –add-service=https
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=public –add-service=pop3
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=public –add-service=smtp
    ```


- Web:


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=web –add-service=http
    ```


- Sales


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=sales –add-service=https
    ```


- Mail


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=mail –add-service=smtp
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=mail –add-service=pop3
    ```


- What is the status of `http`, `https`, `smtp` and `pop3`?


#### Add your adversaries to the Drop Zone.


- Run the command that will add all current and any future blacklisted IPs to the Drop Zone.


     ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=drop –add-source=10.208.56.23
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=drop –add-source=135.95.103.76
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –permanent –zone=drop –add-source=76.34.169.118
    ```


#### Make rules permanent then reload them:


It's good practice to ensure that your `firewalld` installation remains nailed up and retains its services across reboots. This ensure that the network remains secured after unplanned outages such as power failures.


- Run the command that reloads the `firewalld` configurations and writes it to memory


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –reload
    ```


#### View active Zones


Now, we'll want to provide truncated listings of all currently **active** zones. This a good time to verify your zone settings.


- Run the command that displays all zone services.


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –get-active-zones
    ```




#### Block an IP address


- Use a rich-rule that blocks the IP address `138.138.0.3`.


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-rich-rule=’rule family=”ipv4” source address=”138.138.0.3” reject’
    ```


#### Block Ping/ICMP Requests


Harden your network against `ping` scans by blocking `icmp ehco` replies.


- Run the command that blocks `pings` and `icmp` requests in your `public` zone.


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –add-icmp-block=echo-reply –add-icmp-blockecho=request
    ```


#### Rule Check


Now that you've set up your brand new `firewalld` installation, it's time to verify that all of the settings have taken effect.


- Run the command that lists all  of the rule settings. Do one command at a time for each zone.


    ```bash
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=public –list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=sales –list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=mail –list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=web –list-all
    $ sudo firewall-cmd –zone=permanent –list-all
    ```


- Are all of our rules in place? If not, then go back and make the necessary modifications before checking again.




Congratulations! You have successfully configured and deployed a fully comprehensive `firewalld` installation.

### Part 3: IDS, IPS, DiD and Firewalls


Now, we will work on another lab. Before you start, complete the following review questions.


#### IDS vs. IPS Systems


1. Name and define two ways an IDS connects to a network.


   Answer 1: NIDS (Network based Intrusion Detection System). It monitors traffic and filters an entire subnet on a network. It matches all traffic to a known library of attack signatures, PASSIVELY examines network traffic at points that it’s deployed, and relatively easy to deploy and difficult to detect by attackers.


   Answer 2: HIDS (Host based Intrusion Detection System). Runs locally on a host-based system or user’s workstation/server. This acts as a second line of defense against malicious traffic that gets past NIDS. This generates an alert if there are significant differences between the file systems on a host vs previous snapshots/baselines.


2. Describe how an IPS connects to a network.


   Answer: Connected to a mirror port on a switch located directly behind the firewall and monitors traffic for suspicious activity.


3. What type of IDS compares patterns of traffic to predefined signatures and is unable to detect Zero-Day attacks?


   Answer: Signature based. It cannot detect Zero-Day attacks because it compares traffic from a set of predefined lists.


4. Which type of IDS is beneficial for detecting all suspicious traffic that deviates from the well-known baseline and is excellent at detecting when an attacker probes or sweeps a network?


   Answer: Anomaly-based network intrusion detection


#### Defense in Depth


1. For each of the following scenarios, provide the layer of Defense in Depth that applies:


    1.  A criminal hacker tailgates an employee through an exterior door into a secured facility, explaining that they forgot their badge at home.


        Answer: Physical


    2. A zero-day goes undetected by antivirus software.


        Answer: Application


    3. A criminal successfully gains access to HR’s database.


        Answer: Data


    4. A criminal hacker exploits a vulnerability within an operating system.


        Answer: Host


    5. A hacktivist organization successfully performs a DDoS attack, taking down a government website.


        Answer: Data


    6. Data is classified at the wrong classification level.


        Answer: Policy


    7. A state sponsored hacker group successfully firewalked an organization to produce a list of active services on an email server.


        Answer: Perimeter


2. Name one method of protecting data-at-rest from being readable on a hard drive.


    Answer: Drive Encryption


3. Name one method to protect data-in-transit.


    Answer: Data Encryption


4. What technology could provide law enforcement with the ability to track and recover a stolen laptop.


   Answer: Tracking / NICs


5. How could you prevent an attacker from booting a stolen laptop using an external hard drive?


    Answer: Disk Encryption




#### Firewall Architectures and Methodologies


1. Which type of firewall verifies the three-way TCP handshake? TCP handshake checks are designed to ensure that session packets are from legitimate sources.


  Answer: Circuit-Level Gateways, Proxy Firewalls, and/or Next-Generation


2. Which type of firewall considers the connection as a whole? Meaning, instead of looking at only individual packets, these firewalls look at whole streams of packets at one time.


  Answer: Stateful


3. Which type of firewall intercepts all traffic prior to being forwarded to its final destination. In a sense, these firewalls act on behalf of the recipient by ensuring the traffic is safe prior to forwarding it?


  Answer: Proxy




4. Which type of firewall examines data within a packet as it progresses through a network interface by examining source and destination IP address, port number, and packet type- all without opening the packet to inspect its contents?


  Answer: Packet-Filtering




5. Which type of firewall filters based solely on source and destination MAC address?


  Answer: Next-Generation






### Bonus Lab: "Green Eggs & SPAM"
In this activity, you will target spam, uncover its whereabouts, and attempt to discover the intent of the attacker.
 
- You will assume the role of a Jr. Security administrator working for the Department of Technology for the State of California.
 
- As a junior administrator, your primary role is to perform the initial triage of alert data: the initial investigation and analysis followed by an escalation of high priority alerts to senior incident handlers for further review.
 
- You will work as part of a Computer and Incident Response Team (CIRT), responsible for compiling **Threat Intelligence** as part of your incident report.


#### Threat Intelligence Card


**Note**: Log into the Security Onion VM and use the following **Indicator of Attack** to complete this portion of the homework. 


Locate the following Indicator of Attack in Sguil based off of the following:


- **Source IP/Port**: `188.124.9.56:80`
- **Destination Address/Port**: `192.168.3.35:1035`
- **Event Message**: `ET TROJAN JS/Nemucod.M.gen downloading EXE payload`


Answer the following:


1. What was the indicator of an attack?
   - Hint: What do the details of the reveal? 


    Answer: Trojan Downloader of JS.Nemucod




2. What was the adversarial motivation (purpose of attack)?


    Answer: Malware download / ransomware


3. Describe observations and indicators that may be related to the perpetrators of the intrusion. Categorize your insights according to the appropriate stage of the cyber kill chain, as structured in the following table.


| TTP | Example | Findings |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| **Reconnaissance** |  How did they attacker locate the victim? | Reconnaissance
| **Weaponization** |  What was it that was downloaded?| Malware (Malicious software)
| **Delivery** |    How was it downloaded?| Adversary-controlled delivery
| **Exploitation** |  What does the exploit do?| Downloader
| **Installation** | How is the exploit installed?| Possibly ransomware/remote-access trojans
| **Command & Control (C2)** | How does the attacker gain control of the remote machine?| Looked like regular traffic through fake HTTP header
| **Actions on Objectives** | What does the software that the attacker sent do to complete it's tasks?| Could be many things, ransome is the main goal in order to decrypt




    Answer: There was a trojan sent via HTTP port. This was used to gain access to system and install files to lock the system. This possibly to set up ransome for data release.




4. What are your recommended mitigation strategies?


    Answer: Detect attempts to scan organization, stop attacks triggered by alerts. Intercept communications, and/or degrade by creating measures that will try to limit the scope and effect of any potential attacks.


5. List your third-party references.
